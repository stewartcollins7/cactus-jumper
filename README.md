A group project to develop a platforming game for Android devices using the Unity game engine. As this was a university group assignment I cannot submit the whole project as a lot of it was not my work, however I have included code from an earlier build of the project where all the code was mine. The final version had a lot more features, this is just basic game code to give some idea of it.
