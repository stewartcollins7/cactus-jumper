A group project to develop a platforming game for Android devices using the Unity game engine. As this was a university group assignment I cannot submit the whole project as a lot of it was not my work, however I have included code from an earlier build of the project where all the code was mine. The final version had a lot more features, this is just basic game code to give some idea of it.

Most of the work is in GameManager and PlayerController classes, player controller dominates due to the design of Unity game engine.
